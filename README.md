# Assessing Prediction Models for Detecting Presence of Breast Cancer

In this project, five statistical prediction models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Adaptive Boosting) were implemented to assess the prediction of obesity-related breast cancer from routine blood measurements.
